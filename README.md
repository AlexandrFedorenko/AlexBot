## üöÄ Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to run the bot locally:

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
cd REPOSITORY
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
Ensure you have Node.js version 14 or higher installed.
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and add the following:
```
BOT_API_TOKEN=your_bot_token_from_BotFather
ADMIN_ID=your_telegram_id
WEATHER_API_KEY=you_weather_token
NBU_API_URL=you_nbu_token
COINGECKO_API_URL=you_coingecko_token
SECRET_KEY=your_secure_key_32_characters
```

> **Important:** The `SECRET_KEY` must be exactly 32 characters long. It is used for encrypting and decrypting the data.

### 4. Encrypt the recipients file:
Before running the bot, you need to encrypt the `recipients.json` file. Use the provided script:
```bash
node encryptRecipients.js
```

This will generate a file called `recipients.json.enc`, which will be used by the bot.

### 5. Start the bot:
```bash
node bot.js
```

NBU_API_URL=https://api.nbu.gov.ua/exchange-rates

## üîê Working with encrypted files

### Encrypt recipients.json
To encrypt the `recipients.json` file, run the following command:
```bash
node encryptRecipients.js
```

This will create an encrypted file `recipients.json.enc` that the bot will use for storing data securely. After encrypting, you can delete the original `recipients.json` for security:
```bash
rm recipients.json
```

### Decrypt recipients.json.enc
If you need to manually view or modify the data, you can use the provided functions in `storage.js` to decrypt the file. For example, create a script to log decrypted data:
```javascript
const { decryptFile } = require('./utils/storage');

const data = decryptFile('recipients.json.enc');
console.log(data);
```
